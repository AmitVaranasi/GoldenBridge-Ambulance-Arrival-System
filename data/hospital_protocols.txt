EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT PROTOCOLS AND GUIDELINES

=== MYOCARDIAL INFARCTION (MI) / ACUTE CORONARY SYNDROME PROTOCOL ===

Recognition Criteria:
- Chest pain or pressure lasting >20 minutes
- Pain radiating to left arm, jaw, or back
- Associated symptoms: diaphoresis, nausea, shortness of breath
- ECG findings: ST elevation, ST depression, T-wave inversions
- Elevated cardiac biomarkers (troponin)
- Risk factors: history of CAD, angina, hypertension, diabetes, smoking, family history

Critical Vitals Thresholds for MI:
- Heart Rate: Tachycardia (>100 bpm) or bradycardia (<50 bpm)
- Blood Pressure: Hypotension (<90 systolic) or hypertension (>180 systolic)
- SpO2: <94% indicates respiratory compromise

Immediate Actions Required:
1. Activate Catheter Lab immediately (door-to-balloon time goal: <90 minutes)
2. Cardiology team notification
3. Prepare for emergent PCI (Percutaneous Coronary Intervention)
4. Administer:
   - Aspirin 325mg (if not already given)
   - Clopidogrel or Ticagrelor loading dose
   - Heparin bolus
   - Nitroglycerin (if BP permits)
   - Morphine for pain control
5. Continuous cardiac monitoring
6. 12-lead ECG
7. Portable chest X-ray
8. Laboratory: Troponin, CBC, BMP, coagulation studies
9. Type and screen blood
10. Establish two large-bore IVs

Special Considerations:
- If ST-elevation MI (STEMI): Immediate catheter lab activation is priority
- If blood pressure <90 systolic: Hold nitrates, consider inotropic support
- If heart rate >150: Consider rate control
- Prepare for possible complications: cardiogenic shock, arrhythmias

===  CRITICAL VITAL SIGNS - GENERAL ALERT THRESHOLDS ===

CODE BLUE PREP Indicators:
- Heart Rate: <40 bpm or >150 bpm
- Blood Pressure: Systolic <70 mmHg
- SpO2: <85%
- Rapid deterioration in any vital parameter

CODE BLUE (Cardiac Arrest) Indicators:
- Heart Rate: 0 bpm (asystole) or pulseless rhythms
- No blood pressure detectable
- Patient unresponsive

=== TRAUMA PROTOCOL ===

Recognition Criteria:
- Motor vehicle collision
- Fall from height >10 feet
- Penetrating trauma
- Multi-system trauma
- Signs of internal bleeding

Critical Actions:
1. Activate trauma team
2. Prepare trauma bay
3. Ensure blood products available
4. Surgical team on standby
5. CT scanner availability
6. Rapid sequence intubation kit ready

Vital Sign Thresholds:
- Systolic BP <90: Indicates shock
- Heart Rate >120: Compensated shock
- SpO2 <92%: Respiratory compromise

=== STROKE PROTOCOL ===

Recognition Criteria:
- Sudden onset focal neurological deficit
- Facial drooping, arm weakness, speech difficulty
- Time of symptom onset critical

Actions:
- Activate stroke team
- Immediate CT scan
- Consider thrombolytic therapy if within time window
- Neurologist consultation

=== SEPSIS PROTOCOL ===

Recognition Criteria:
- Fever or hypothermia
- Tachycardia, tachypnea
- Hypotension
- Altered mental status
- Source of infection

Actions:
- Blood cultures before antibiotics
- Broad-spectrum antibiotics within 1 hour
- Fluid resuscitation
- Lactate level
- Source control

=== GENERAL ER PREPARATION GUIDELINES ===

When ambulance ETA <5 minutes:
1. Clear appropriate bed in ER
2. Notify attending physician
3. Prepare necessary equipment based on complaint
4. Have nursing team ready for immediate assessment
5. Ensure monitoring equipment functional
6. Have emergency medications accessible

Documentation Requirements:
- All pre-hospital interventions
- Medication administration times
- Vital sign trends
- Patient complaints and symptoms
- Relevant medical history
- Allergies

Communication Protocol:
- EMS should provide update at 10 minutes out
- Final update at 2-5 minutes out
- Direct radio communication for critical patients
- Clear handoff upon arrival with SBAR format
